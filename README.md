## Day 1

### Unpkg - Michael Jackson - 9:00 AM
Speaker: [Michael Jackson](https://github.com/mjackson)<br>
Topic: Unpkg.com<br>
Twitter: [@unpkg](https://twitter.com/unpkg)<br>
Demos: https://github.com/unpkg/unpkg-demos<br>
Local: [unpkg-demos](unpkg-demos) <br>

**Notes:**
- What is it?
    - Global CDN for everything on npm
    - Quickly and easily load any file from any package
- Module support is coming to browsers

*"Just imagine what a cool world it would be if everyone only loaded React once..."*

### D3 and React - Shirley Wu - 9:30 AM
Speaker: [Shirley Wu](https://github.com/sxywu)<br>
Topic: D3 and React<br>
Presentation Link: https://github.com/sxywu/react-d3<br>
Local: [react-d3](react-d3) <br>

**Notes:**
- Data visualization
- Who *needs* control of the DOM?
- D3 only needs the DOM in 3 places
    + transitions (x,y position, color changes, etc.)
    + axes (we tell D3 what we want, it updates for us)
    + brushes (event binding)
- D3 doesn't need the DOM for
    + layouts
    + geo
    + shape
- React renders, D3 calculates
- D3 is more than enough for hover, click, and other simple interactions. React comes in handy for more complicated UIs and interactions.
- Use React with D3 when you need to manage state in your app
- When React renders
    + if user interaction *does* mutate data
    + propagates from parent
    + calculate in `componentWillReceiveProps`

### React for IOT - Devon Lindsey - 10:30 AM
Speaker: [Devon Lindsey](https://github.com/devonbl) <br>
Topic: A Hand Wave of React for All Your Internet of Thangs <br>
Twitter: [@devonbl](https://twitter.com/devonbl) <br>
Presentation Link: N/A <br>
Local: N/A <br>

**Notes:**
- What the heck is NFC? Near Field Communication
    + EX: Card that is used for mass transit, work badge, etc.
- What NFC is **not**
    + A tracking device
- "I have an NFC implant in my hand, I want to wire it up to my house using IOT technology" 😳
- Random fact: Arduino != Raspberry Pi
    + Raspberry Pi entry barrier is much lower - it has an awesome community
    + See: https://github.com/raspberrypi
- Technologies Used:
    + Johnny Five: http://johnny-five.io/ - used for IOT
    + raspi-io: https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-io - Provides IO for Johnny-Five on Raspberry Pi
    + react-hardware: https://github.com/iamdustan/react-hardware

**TLDR**: This woman literally put an NFC chip in her hand so she can unlock her house by swiping her hand... because old school keys are overrated. Pretty intense stuff.

### Back to React - Michael Chan - 11:00 AM
Speaker: [Michael Chan](https://github.com/chantastic) <br>
Topic: Back to React: The Story of Two Apps <br>
Twitter: [@chantastic](http://twitter.com/chantastic) <br>
Presentation Link: N/A <br>
Local: N/A <br>

**Notes:**
- React represents the V in MVC frameworks
- Easy to plug components into an application
- Why React is great
    + Big components + better patterns
    + Context
    + inline-styles + CSS
    + RTFM + nothing else existed

- 5 Important Keys to Being a React Developer:
    + Know who's driving
        * In order to be a React developer, you need to know the following (Holy Trinity of React):
            - React
            - React-router
            - Redux
            - React-router-redux
        * It's getting more and more complicated, which is a possible deterrent for people looking into using React
        * What role does react play in your app?
    + Optimize for change
    + Know your component shapes (master the patterns)
    + Avoid the edges
        * "Dont forget it's not the edge that's bleeding, it's you."
        * If you're the one using bleeding edge technology, you'll be feeling the pain
    + Partner, don't depend
        * "Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug."
        * Stop delegating

### What WebAssembly Means for React - Lin Clark - 11:30 AM
Speaker: [Lin Clark](https://github.com/linclark) <br>
Topic: What WebAssembly Means for React <br>
Twitter: [@linclark](https://twitter.com/linclark) <br>
Presentation Link: N/A <br>
Local: N/A <br>

**Notes:**
- What is WebAssembly?
    + From [webassembly.org](http://webassembly.org/): "WebAssembly or wasm is a new portable, size- and load-time-efficient format suitable for compilation to the web."
    + It's possible/will be possible to update the DOM in the browser in programming languages other than JavaScript (such as C/C++)
- Possible benefits
    + Reuse code
    + Run faster in the browser
- WebAssembly can currently only understand `integers` and `floats`
- Decoding WebAssembly is faster than parsing JavaScript
- WebAssembly Flow
    + parse
    + compile + optimize
    + re-optimize
    + execute
    + garbage collection

### Layperson's guide to React Fiber - Ben Ilegbodu - 2:00 PM
Speaker: [Ben Ilegbodu](https://github.com/benmvp) <br>
Topic: Layperson's guide to React Fiber <br>
Twitter: [@benmvp](https://twitter.com/benmvp) <br>
Presentation Link: N/A <br>
Local: N/A <br>

**Notes:**
- What is React Fiber?
    + Rewrite of reconciler
    + Prioritizes UI updates
    + Enables async rendering
    + Improves perceived performance
    + Will be released in next major React version (v16)
- React@16 is 20% smaller than React@15
- React@15.5 deprecations --> React@16 errors
- Adjacent JSX elements is *still* an error in React 16, but arrays are valid component return values in React 16!

```
const pageBody = () => ([
    (<aside key="aside"> LEFT NAV </aside>),
    (<section key="section"> MAIN BODY </section>)
]);
```

- Strings are also valid return values in React 16
- Uncaught errors now unmount your app --> blank page
- New `componentDidCatch` lifecycle method!
    +  Can be used to create error boundary components
    +  Wrap top-level route components in error boundary components
    +  This basically allows us to simulate server-side errors on the client
- No more `data-reactid` attributes from server - it's normal HTML
- Use new `ReactDOM.hydrate()` on client
- Fiber makes React renderers easier to build

`npm install --save react@next react-dom@next`

### ReacTex - Bonnie Milián - 2:30 PM
Speaker: [Bonnie Milián](https://github.com/BonnieMilian) <br>
Topic: ReacTex: using React Native and Neural Networks to recognize handwritten equations <br>

### React Native for Web - Nicolas Gallagher - 4:00 PM
Speaker: [Nicolas Gallagher](https://github.com/necolas) <br>
Topic: Twitter Lite, React Native, and Progressive Web Apps handwritten equations <br>
Twitter: [@necolas](https://twitter.com/necolas) <br>
Presentation Link: N/A <br>
Local: N/A <br>

**Notes:**
- React Native for Web: https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web
- React is becoming a *Software Development Platform* (it's more than just a frontend framework)
- React is focused on separation of concerns rather than separation of technologies (i.e. you can see HTML, CSS, and JS in a component)
- React native is easier and simpler than React DOM
    + Contains standard foundations for abstractions (touch events, scaling, etc.)

### Redux + ServiceWorker = Offline React - Zack Argyle - 5:00 PM
Speaker: [Zack Argyle](https://github.com/zackargyle) <br>
Topic: Redux + ServiceWorker = Offline React <br>
Twitter: [@ZackArgyle](https://twitter.com/ZackArgyle) <br>
Presentation: N/A <br>
Local: N/A <br>

**Notes:**
- https://github.com/pinterest/service-workers
- Service workers are essentially the secretary for your app - they'll make requests to servers for you.
- Service Workers
    + Network Proxy
    + Precaching
    + Runtime Caching
    + Push Notifications
    + Background Sync
    + Offline Network Management
- Service Worker Fetch Strategies
    + Prefer cache
    + Cache only
    + Offline only
    + Network only - don't cache anything
    + Race/Fastest - sometimes it takes longer to look up from cache than to request from the server
- How to register a Service Worker:

```
if ('servieWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('sw.js');
}
```

- App Shell
    + Generic/Cacheable
    + Progressively loads app
    + Fast TTFP
    + **If you care about SEO, continue to server render**
