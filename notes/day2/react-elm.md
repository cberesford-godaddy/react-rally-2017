**Notes:**
- https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example
- React and Elm both use a virtual DOM
    + Special syntax (JSX) for React, no special syntax for Elm
- React and Elm both have a unidirectional flow
    + Elm Architecture: Model --> HTML --> Elm Runtime System --> Msg --> Model
- Another commonality between React and Elm: Immutability
    + `shouldComponentUpdate`
- They both have "Static Analysis"
    + EX: Linter (something that can help improve your code)
