- What the heck is NFC? Near Field Communication
    + EX: Card that is used for mass transit, work badge, etc.
- What NFC is **not**
    + A tracking device
- "I have an NFC implant in my hand, I want to wire it up to my house using IOT technology" ðŸ˜³
- Random fact: Arduino != Raspberry Pi
    + Raspberry Pi entry barrier is much lower - it has an awesome community
    + See: https://github.com/raspberrypi
- Technologies Used:
    + Johnny Five: http://johnny-five.io/ - used for IOT
    + raspi-io: https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-io - Provides IO for Johnny-Five on Raspberry Pi
    + react-hardware: https://github.com/iamdustan/react-hardware

**TLDR**: This woman literally put an NFC chip in her hand so she can unlock her house by swiping her hand... because old school keys are overrated. Pretty intense stuff.
